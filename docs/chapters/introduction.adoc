== Introduction

WildFly 8 (nee JBoss Application Server 7) is a lightweight, flexible, Java EE 7 compliant, polyglot, and open source application server.

This self-paced hands-on lab gets you introduced to the basic features of WildFly 8.

NOTE: This document is a work in progress.

=== Getting Started

Download the WildFly 8 `Application Server Distribution' zip file from http://wildfly.org/downloads/ and unzip.

Lets get familiar with the directory structure.

[cols="2,8", options="header"]
|===
| Directory | Purpose

| appclient
| Configuration files, deployment content, log files, and writeable areas used by the application client from this installation

| bin
| Startup scripts, startup configuration files and other command line utilities

| docs
| Documentation

| domain
| Configuration files, deployment content, log files, and writeable areas used by the managed domain from this installation

| domain/lib/ext
| Directory for installed library jars referenced by applications using the Extension-List mechanism for this domain

| domain/servers
| Writable area for each application server instance that runs in this domain. Each server has its own directory., created when the server is started.

| modules
| Various modules used in the server

| standalone
| Configuration files, deployment content, log files, and writeable areas used by the single standalone server from this installation

| standalone/deployments
| Directory for filesystem-based automatic deployment

| standalone/lib/ext
| Directory for installed library jars referenced by applications using the Extension-List mechanism for this instance

| welcome-content
| Default welcome page content

==== Standalone and Managed Domain

WildFly 8 can be started in two different modes:

. A _standalone_ server is an independent instance. It can be started using `bin/standalone.sh` or `bin/standalone.bat` launch scripts.
+
. A _managed domain_ that allows you to run and manage a multi-server topology and manage multiple WildFly instances from a single control point. It can be started using `bin/domain.sh` or `bin/domain.bat` launch scripts.
+
A Domain Controller is the central management control point for the collection of servers in the `domain'. More details about starting WildFly in managed domain mode, server topology and central management is explained in <<clustering>>.

==== Web Profile and Full Platform

Java EE defines _profiles_ that represent a configuration of the full platform suited to a particular class of applications. The Java EE Web Profile is defined as a separate specification in the platform, and is defined as a subset of technologies contained in the platform and targeted toward the developers of modern web applications. WildFly supports both Web Profile and Full Platform by defininig `configuration profiles'.

The default startup mode for the standalone server is web profile. So if you start as:

[source]
----
./bin/standalone.sh
----

then this starts WildFly single instance server in web profile.

Alternatively, it can be started in full platform by specifying the configuration as:

[source]
----
./bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
----

The name of the exact configuration file (one of `*.xml` files) from the `standalone/configuration' directory is specified as the parameter.

A standalone server can be started with full platform and clustering capabilities using:

[source]
----
./bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml
----

This lab will mostly use standalone server in default profile. Lets start the server as:

[source]
----
./bin/standalone.sh
----

Access http://localhost:8080 and see the following page to make sure the server is running correctly.

==== Multiple instances on the same machine

Multiple instances of standalone server can be started on the same machine by specifying a port offset to the `standalone.sh` script.

Lets start another instance of standalone server at port 9080 using the following command:

[source]
----
./bin/standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=1000
----

After the server is stated the welcome page is now accessible at http://localhost:9080.

Use Ctrl+C to stop the running server.

=== Configure Logging

WildFly provides comprehensive logging output from different subsystems. Same framework can be used to enable logging from user applications as well.

*Purpose*: This section explains how to use and configure logging in WildFly.

. Change log levels of existing subsystems
+
. Change logging format of existing logger
+
. Create custom logger
+
. Where to copy custom logging handler ? (class loading)
